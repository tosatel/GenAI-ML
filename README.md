Purpose: It allows users to interact with a SQL database using natural language queries (like "Show me sales by region").

Features:

Connects to a SQL database (default is Northwind sample database)

Uses OpenAI's language models to translate natural language to SQL

Displays query results as interactive tables

Maintains a chat history of your questions and the AI's responses

Key Components
1. Imports
The code imports several important libraries:

streamlit for the web interface

sqlalchemy for database connections

pandas for data manipulation

OpenAI and langchain for AI capabilities

Custom SQLDatabaseAgent from Business Science's AI Data Science Team package

2. Configuration
Sets up database options (currently just Northwind sample DB)

Defines available OpenAI models

Configures the Streamlit page

3. User Interface
Main Panel: Displays chat history and query results

Sidebar:

Database selection

OpenAI API key input

Model selection

4. Core Functionality
Creates a SQL agent that can translate natural language to SQL

Handles queries asynchronously

Stores results in session state for display and download
